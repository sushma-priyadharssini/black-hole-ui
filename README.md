## 🎯 Rules of the Game

- Players take turns placing their numbered tokens (1–21) onto the board.

- The last remaining cell becomes the Black Hole.

- At the end of the game, all tokens adjacent to the Black Hole are "consumed".

- Each player’s score = sum of their consumed tokens.

- The player with the lowest total score wins.
